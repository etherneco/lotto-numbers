# Lotto Numbers

## Overview
This repository explores basic statistical analysis of lottery draw data.

It was created as a lightweight experiment to better understand:
- randomness
- probability distribution
- frequency analysis
- limitations of pattern detection in stochastic systems

This project does **not** attempt to predict lottery outcomes.

---

## Context
Lottery numbers represent a well-known example of a truly random process that is often misunderstood.

This repository treats lottery data as a convenient and familiar dataset for:
- experimenting with data processing
- validating statistical assumptions
- demonstrating why pattern-based prediction fails in random systems

---

## Scope
The focus of this project is limited to:
- historical draw analysis
- frequency distribution
- basic statistical observations
- visualisation of results (where applicable)

No claims are made regarding predictive accuracy.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Random systems naturally produce apparent patterns
- Frequency bias does not imply predictability
- Data analysis must be interpreted within correct probabilistic boundaries

---

## Tech Stack
- Language-specific scripting (depending on implementation)
- Basic statistical tooling
- Simple data parsing and processing

---

## Status
- Experimental
- Educational
- Not intended for production or prediction use

---

## Why This Project Exists
This repository demonstrates:
- practical data analysis on real datasets
- understanding of randomness and statistical limits
- responsible interpretation of analytical results

It is intentionally simple and honest in scope.
